# ANPR Parking Barrier

## Overview
This project implements an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system integrated with a parking barrier, serving as both an entry and exit gate. Vehicle license plates are detected using a YOLO-based model, and the text is accurately extracted using PaddleOCR. The system automatically calculates parking fees based on the entry and exit times. Payment can be made in two ways: via RFID cards, simulating contactless payment cards, or automatically using a linked payment card based on the license plate number for registered users. The included web application allows clients to view their parking history, link their payment card to a license plate, and check their balance. Administrators have access to parking statistics, an interactive chart of customer activity, and tools for database management. This project is a final assignment for the Embedded Systems course.
